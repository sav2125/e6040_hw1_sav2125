We used the JAFFE dataset in this assignment.

The assignment contained a script download.sh that will download and unzip the dataset. A public AMI_E6040_hw1 ami has been 
created with all necessary packages and patches preinstalled for solving this assignment.
In this assignment, we divided the image into small blocks and then performed Principal Component Analysis(PCA). 
We then reconstructed image using different number of principal components and top components.
